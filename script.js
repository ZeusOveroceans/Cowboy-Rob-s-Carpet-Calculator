/* LEVEL UP! (optional) 
	1. Function explanations:

  calculateCarpet() is a function that calculates the total cost of a carpet installation.


	2. Custom styles added: 

  To customize my page I began by going into index.html and changing the header image to that of an actual cowboy rug. I then went into CSS and changed the background colors for all sections to match the aesthetic of the cowboy rug. I went on to add a border radius to all sections to make it feel like the rounded finish of a rug.
